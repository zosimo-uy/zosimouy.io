              <p class="lead">
                <span class="fw-semibold">I delved into the world of computers at the age of 10</span>, initially captivated by games. Through gaming, I gained hands-on experience with computer hardware, which sparked my curiosity and set the foundation for my computer journey. As I grew more familiar with technology, I began customizing my Friendster profile, adding URL links, editing text and backgrounds, and even incorporating music. These early experiences allowed me to <span class="fw-semibold">explore my creative side</span> and <span class="fw-semibold">express myself</span> through digital mediums.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                Driven by my passion, I pursued a <span class="fw-semibold">B.S. in Computer Engineering</span>, as it seemed a natural progression for someone whose life had been profoundly impacted by computers. Throughout my studies, I immersed myself in electronics, mechatronics, and the practical application of digital I/O and sensors. Although my programming exposure was limited, I used microcontrollers to automate processes and develop industrial machines, further cementing my passion for the intersection of electronics and programming.

              <p class="lead">
                In recent months, I made a <span class="fw-semibold">pivotal decision to switch careers</span> and enrolled in a <span class="fw-semibold">full-stack web development bootcamp</span>. Through determination and hard work, I successfully passed their technical exam and completed the required activities, projects, and capstone to earn certification under Kodego PH.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                This journey into web development <span class="fw-semibold">reignited my love for programming</span> and allowed me to rediscover my true calling.
